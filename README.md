### How to reuse

You've cloned the project and you're wanting to make it your own. But..."ReactNativeStarter".

With [react-native-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename), React Native Rename will replace all files, directories and references of `ReactNativeStarter` to what ever you'd like.

#### Install the package
```
yarn global add react-native-rename

```
#### Rename the App
```
react-native-rename NewAppName
```

#### Change ApiHost

Please change your API HOST in `./src/config/apiConfig`

For example, change:

```JavaScript
const API_HOST = ''

export default API_HOST

```
To:

```
const API_HOST = 'https://yourhost'

export default API_HOST

```

Then you can build your own App on the basis of ReactNativeStarter! üôåüèª
